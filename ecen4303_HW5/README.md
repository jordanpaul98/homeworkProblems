HW5. 4.14
for the transistor in prob 4.1, assume Vsb = 0v and plot Ids vs Vds for Vgs = 1 and Vgs = 1.5
using (a) (4.7.11) with 4.7.2 and (b) (4.7.24), first using alpha from (4.7.27),
and then modifying the value of alpha to improve accuracy

Vgb = 1.0v: Improved alpha = 1.099
Vgb = 1.5v: Improved alpha = 1.106
